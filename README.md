Music Bot components extracted from [harunon.js](https://github.com/CarelessDev/harunon.js)

## How to use

This package has 2 parts, the underlying mechanics and the part that consume it.

You likely only want to import complete Music Cog which is compatible to [cocoa-discord-utils](https://github.com/Leomotors/cocoa-discord-utils)

See Example at [tests/bot.js](./tests/bot.js)

Apart from that, if you can understand the code [src/voice.ts](src/voice.ts),
you can directly interact with api underneath, all of them is public.

*Note: It is known issues that search feature summon duplicate embed, I blame discord.js for this bug*

## Note

- This module has its cog named "Music", be sure to not creating a duplicate name

- Despite cocoa-discord-utils supports CommonJS, this module does not

- This module is still in beta, not implemented features includes but not limited to: Working in edge cases for example, user invoke command without being in voice channel
