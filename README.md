Music Bot components extracted from [harunon.js](https://github.com/CarelessDev/harunon.js)

## How to use

This package has 2 parts, the underlying mechanics and the part that consume it.

You likely only want to import complete Music Cog which is compatible to [cocoa-discord-utils](https://github.com/Leomotors/cocoa-discord-utils)

*See Example at tests/bot.js*

Apart from that, if you can understand the code [src/voice.ts](src/voice.ts),
you can directly interact with api underneath, all of them is public.

## Prerequisites

- node 16 (Minimum required by discord.js, What my bots are optimized for)

- **IMPORTANT** [Encoding Libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discordjs/voice#dependencies)
(This library does not ship these encoding libraries, so you can freely decide which one to install)

## âœ¨Features

- play from YouTube

- queue

- pause / resume

- Loop

- Remove from Queue and Clear

- Search with beautiful embeds

## Note

- This module has its cog named "Music", be sure to not creating a duplicate name
